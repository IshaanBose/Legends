Legends is a TTRPG group-finder app. The purpose of Legends is to provide an easy way of finding people in your locality to play various TTRPGs with.

**Features:**
* Easy to find groups: easily find groups to play TTRPGs with using various filters to find groups according to your preferences.
* In-app chat: an in-app chat feature so you can keep all group discussions within the app.
* Dice roller: a dice roller with various functions to make your game playing experience smoother.

Install the app from [here.](https://github.com/IshaanBose/Legends/tree/master/app/build/outputs/apk/debug)

**NOTE:** This app was developed as part of my final year project. If the app is not functioning, it could possibly be due to the Firebase server being down by either my actions or through actions taken by Firebase. Additionally, while I tried to keep sensitive information secure, extensive testing was not done to ensure that private data cannot be retrieved by malicious users. It is recommended to use a dummy email following the following format: a@b.cd. Also, please do not use this app for meeting people IRL as I am the only real moderator and do not check the app. I am not responsible for the safety of anyone using this app to actually meet people, there is the reason why this was never released on the Google App Store.
